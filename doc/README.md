## üí° Common Use Cases

### Single Application Monitoring
Monitor logs from one application with basic filtering:
```toml
[[streams]]
name = "myapp"
[streams.monitor]
targets = [{ path = "/var/log/myapp", pattern = "*.log" }]
[[streams.filters]]
type = "include"
patterns = ["ERROR", "WARN"]
```

### Multi-Service Architecture
Monitor multiple services with different configurations:
```bash
logwisp --router --config /etc/logwisp/services.toml
```

### High-Security Environments
Enable authentication and rate limiting:
```toml
[streams.httpserver.rate_limit]
enabled = true
requests_per_second = 10.0
max_connections_per_ip = 3
```
